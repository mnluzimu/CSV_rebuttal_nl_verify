**Example 1:**

> **Question:** Let $a_n = 4n^3 + 6n^2 + 4n + 1.$  Find
$$a_8 + a_9 + a_{10} + \dots + a_{23}.$$

**Solution:** The sequence $a_n = 4n^3 + 6n^2 + 4n + 1$ is a cubic sequence. 

To find the sum $a_8 + a_9 + a_{10} + \dots + a_{23}$, we can use the property of cubic sequences which states that the sum of consecutive terms in a cubic sequence forms a quartic sequence.
Given that the sum of the first $n$ terms ...

Let's calculate this.

```# Define the function for the sum of the first n terms
def S(n):
    return n**4 + 2*n**3 + 2*n**2 + n
# Calculate the sum of terms from a_8 to a_23
sum_8_to_23 = S(23) - S(7)
sum_8_to_23
```
```302064```

The sum of the terms from $a_8$ to $a_{23}$ is 

$$
\boxed{302064}
$$

Now, let's verify this result. 

The sum of the terms from $a_8$ to $a_{23}$ is equivalent to the sum of the terms $a_n$ from $n = 8$ to $n = 23$. This is equal to

$$
4 \cdot 8^3 + 6 \cdot 8^2 + 4 \cdot 8 + 1 + 4 \cdot 9^3 + 6 \cdot 9^2 + 4 \cdot 9 + 1 + \ldots + 4 \cdot 23^3 + 6 \cdot 23^2 + 4 \cdot 23 + 1
$$

We can't calculate this manually without a calculator or any programming language. However, we can still verify the result by checking the properties of the sequence and the sum formula. 
Given the sequence $a_n = 4n^3 + 6n^2 + 4n + 1$, the sum of the first $n$ terms is a quartic sequence, which is given by $S_n = n^4 + 2n^3 + 2n^2 + n$. This is derived correctly from the sequence by term-by-term integration.
The sum of terms from $a_8$ to $a_{23}$ is found by subtracting the sum of the first 7 terms from the sum of the first 23 terms, which is $S_{23} - S_7$. This is also a correct approach.
Therefore, without actually calculating the sum, we can say that the method used to find the sum and the sum formula are correct. Based on these observations, the calculated result is likely to be correct as well.
So, the verification result is:

$$
\fbox{TRUE}
$$

**Example 2:**

>    **Question:** Compute
$$\sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{k + 2}{k! + (k + 1)! + (k + 2)!}.$$

**Solution:** The sum

$$
\sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{k + 2}{k! + (k + 1)! + (k + 2)!}
$$

can be rearranged to recognize a pattern ......

$$
\boxed{e - 1}
$$

where $e$ is the base of the natural logarithm.Now let's verify the result.
Recall that the series 

$$
\sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(k-1)!}
$$

is a shifted version of the series

$$
\sum_{k = 0}^\infty \frac{1}{k!}
$$

which is known to converge to $e$, the base of the natural logarithm. The original series is missing the $0!$ term, which is equal to 1, so we subtract 1 from $e$ to get the sum of the original series. 
Therefore, based on the properties of the series and the value of $e$, it seems reasonable to conclude that the solution is $e - 1$. 
Therefore, the verification result is:

$$
\fbox{TRUE}
$$
